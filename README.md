# Fine-Tuned T5 Summarization API

A Flask-based API for text summarization using a fine-tuned T5 model. The model is trained on the **CNN/DailyMail** dataset, optimized via knowledge distillation with Pegasus Large, and further enhanced using custom techniques for cleaner and more concise summaries.

## Features

- **State-of-the-art Summarization**: Powered by T5, fine-tuned on CNN/DailyMail.
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Leveraged Pegasus Large to improve model outputs.
- **Custom Enhancements**:
  - Removes low-relevance lines based on TF-IDF scores.
  - Eliminates repeated lines for cleaner summaries.
- **Flask API**: Simple REST API for generating summaries.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fine-tuned-t5-summarization-api.git
cd fine-tuned-t5-summarization-api
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Add the Fine-Tuned Model

- Unzip your fine-tuned model into the `trained_model/` directory.  
  If you have the model as a `.zip` file:
  ```bash
  unzip transformer.zip -d trained_model/
  ```

### 4. Run the Flask App

```bash
python app.py
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Model Details

- **Base Model**: T5 fine-tuned on CNN/DailyMail.
- **Optimization**: Knowledge distillation using Pegasus Large.
- **Custom Enhancements**:
  - TF-IDF-based line scoring to remove low-relevance sentences.
  - Removal of duplicate lines for clarity.

## Notes

- Ensure that the `trained_model/` directory contains the fine-tuned model files.
- The API runs on port `5000` by default. You can change the port using the `PORT` environment variable:
  ```bash
  export PORT=8080
  python app.py
  ```
